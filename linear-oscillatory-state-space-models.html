</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>A common critique of machine learning research is that the results of many papers are based on trial-and-error, often representing only minor modifications of existing approaches and without any proper justification of the design decisions. The typical justification for publication is that a model resulted in a good score on some established benchmark, with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00561">validity of these benchmarks</a> being a topic on its own. Even from an engineering perspective this is obviously highly undesirable.</p>
<p>I was therefore very delighted by a preliminary reading of <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=GRMfXcAAFh">Linear oscillatory state-space models</a> presented by T. Konstantin Rusch and Daniela Rus at ICLR 2025. This publication combines several desirable qualities.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is based on a justified theoretical model</li>
<li>The approach strongly inspired by physics and neurobiology</li>
<li>It exercises mathematical rigour<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>It includes empirical evidence</li>
<li>It provides a reference implementation</li>
<li>The approach could have substantial impact in multiple domains</li>
<li>It is actually an enjoyable read!</li>
</ol>
<p>Leaving aside the formal perspective, the ability to model very long-range interactions on multivariate sequences with high accuracy using a theoretically well-grounded model makes the publication appealing especially for domains where explainability is important.</p>
<hr>
<p><sub>1. I have not verified the claims, but as opposed to theoretical contributions in other publications, given sufficient time the proofs actually appear rather digestable mainly drawing from Calculus and Linear Algebra</sub></p>
